## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Nick, a Data Analyst with an interest in transforming raw data into insights.

ðŸŒ± I am skilled in SQL and Excel.  I enjoy learning new technologies and deepening my expertise in those I already know.  
ðŸ˜„ Outside the tech world I enjoy spending time outside, hiking, canoeing, snowboarding, reading, exercising, playing video games, and reading.

Thanks for visiting my page; below are some of the SQL projects I have completed.
